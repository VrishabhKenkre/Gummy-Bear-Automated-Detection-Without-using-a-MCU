Gummy bear candy's act like subtractive color filters. I built a small fixture with five LEDs (white, blue, yellow, red, green) on one side and a phototransistor on the other. Each LED is turned on in sequence; the sensor reading is digitized with Schmitt-trigger comparators and the pass/fail bits are stored in 74HC164 shift registers. Simple logic then asserts the output LED for the detected colorâ€”no microcontroller required.
